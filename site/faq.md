## May I join the contest once it has already started?

Yes, even if the CODE'N'STRIPES challenge link will be activated for 24 hours, the first 10 to complete the actual coding challenge will be the ones getting the prize (see more info about winning and prizes on the [Terms and Conditions](/terms-and-conditions))

So, if you think you can make it, go and jump right on it!

## Will I get a chance to apply for any adidas job posting?

Of course, our job openings are available [HERE](https://careers.adidas-group.com/), and you will also receive a communication about them after the challenge, but if interested now, go ahead and apply!

## What does this challenge consist of?

Specific details about the challenge itself will be published when the challenge starts so everyone has the same chances. Don't worry, you won't need to design & implement any fancy system. It will be just a coding exercise solvable within one day.

## What programming languages can I use?

This is the list of supported programming languages:
- Golang
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Python (2 & 3)
- Swift
- TypeScript

## How do I know how much progress within the challenge I made?

You'll be provided a test suite that you can run at any time without any penalty. Your final score will be computed based on these tests and some hidden ones. You'll see the "Run tests" button once you login into the platform and start the task.

## I'm satisfied with my code. How do I present it?

You need to submit your code. In the lower right corner you'll see the "Submit" button. Don't forget to also click "Finish" from the main dashboard.

## I already submitted my code but I made some improvements. Can I submit the new version?

Yes, you can submit all the times you want as long as you don't click "Finish". Beware, though, that we'll only take into account your latest submission. This applies both to score (number of tests passed) and time required for coding the solution.

As an example, if your first submission has an score of 50% in one hour and your second one is 100% in two hours, your first submission will be discarded and we'll only consider the 100% score in two hours.

## How will I know if I won?

Due to data privacy, we can't publish the name of the winners. But don't worry! If you won, we'll contact you via email within a week. This is why it's so important that you login with a valid email address.

## Will the solution to the challenge be published?

Yes, once the challenge is finished we'll publish the solution. Notice that, as usual in coding, there can be many valid solutions to a problem, so this solution will be just a valid one.
