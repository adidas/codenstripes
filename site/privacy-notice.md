1. All participants of Contests need to register on the CodeSignal platform separately.

They will do so in sole separate data controllership.
1. adidas will create the CODE'N'STRIPES challenges and tests for the participants, hence adidas will manage the processing of personal participant data on the platform related to the microchallenges. After participants' registration to the platform and Contest, adidas will get access to participant-generated content (coding input and results) and personal data (name and email address) on CodeSignal platform.
1. adidas will assess the participant results for selecting the winners. The top 10 Winners of the microchallenge will be contacted via email by adidas teams to facilitate the prize distribution and sending to participants. In that course, we will ask for your shipping details to facilitate the delivery of your price. We will further ask for your permission to get your name, or if preferred, your alias disclosed on the leaderboard.
1. Also links to open job descriptions will be sent via email to participants. In that course, we will only collect click-related data in an aggregated manner for analytics purposes.

### 2.4 How long will we be keeping your personal data? (**"Retention Period"**)

Your data will be deleted from the CodeSignal platform after the termination of the Contest. Winner Participant Data (name and email) will be held to avoid multiple participations for the duration of the CODE'N'STRIPES challenges (according to T&C's).
